*	Various updates to Gtk, sys, pq (PostgreSQL) and other modules.

*	bignum module added

*	libshout module, shout, added.

*	PostgreSQL module, pq, added.  This is a direct mapping
	of the C API to ICI.  The code was written by Andy Newman
	for Silverbrook Research.

*	ptime() added to str module (does ANSI C's strptime).

*	Gtk substantially enhanced.

*	Released as ici-modules-0.1.0 on 14 August 2000.

*	Modules fixed to build against either ici 2 or ici 3.
	Use "make ICIV=ici" or "make ICIV=ici3".

*	Tim Long has written an module, dll, that allows calling
	arbitrary functions in native-code libraries. It works
	for Windows and Andy ported it to FreeBSD and Linux on
	the 80x86 and Solaris on the Sparc.

*	Windows port commenced.  Many of the modules now build and
	function on Windows (NT, 95 & 98 have NOT been tested). The
	X11-dependent modules have not been ported although it is
	technically feasible (I don't use X11 client-side things on
	Windows).

*	OpenGL interface exists but there's something wrong with the
	GLX bit which is stopping it working.

*	Made the serialisation code use the processor to determine
	if its little or big endian rather than rely on user config.

*	Net and sys modules improved. Various limitations removed from
	both and many name changes to remove the chance of problems when
	used with ici's with sockets and system calls still configured.

*	More makefile changes with new tools. FreeBSD 3.x is the development
	platform with Linux and Solaris being the port platforms.

*	More work everywhere. Tools re-written to be (a) correct and
	(b) not complete hacks. Configuration better now with removal
	of references to anything in modules from the config code.

*	Imlib module added that gives provides easy image support for
	the X module.

*	env module brought back. This gives you access to the process
	environment as a struct.

*	OpenGL interface via the gl module added.

*	Many changes in the X11 module. Loads more functions etc...
	and changes to the way external (i.e., X server) resouces
	are freed - ici garbage collection no longer frees the
	X resources, the programmer must explictly free them.

News for version 0.3

*	Lots of makefile cleanups. The Linux versions work. I use
	the modules on RedHat Linux 4.2, 5.2 and FreeBSD 2.2.8. I
	have built the modules on Solaris but not used them much.

*	A nearly complete interface to Window Maker's WINGs toolkit is
	provided in the wings directory. This also includes the Window
	Maker wmlib functions for Window Maker specific applications
	although I haven't been successful at making both work together.
	Individually they're fine.

*	The tools to auto-generate code have been tidied up a little
	and enhanced. They still need to be totally rewritten but they're
	a little better than they were.

xml module news

*	There are now some ici wrapper functions for parsing an XML
	stream and reading it into an in-memory data structure which
	may be processed using a simple interface. The in-memory
	structure may then be output to an stream (as XML).

X module news

*	The X module now has more functions and support for more
	X and Xlib types. It is still far from complete but useful
	programs are able to be written using it.

net module news

*	Names in the net module have been changed to ensure there
	are no clashes with the current sockets code in the ici
	interpreter. Also several functions have had little bug
	fixes or small changes in their interface. Nothing major.

*	net.getpeername() no longer maps the port number to a service
	name (stupid thing to do in the first place!).

*	net.socket() may be passed an integer (file descriptor) to be
	turned into a socket object with that descriptor.

serialisation module news

*	Several fixes to the object serialisation code (again dynamic
	linking issues rather than the actual code).

*	You can now specify a scope to restore which is used as the
	scope for any function objects de-serialised. This is needed
	if you want to control what objects are accessible to restored
	functions. Without it there is always a path out of any sandbox
	you attempt to enforce on the functions. Now there isn't.

sys module news

*	The functions in the posix module are now also in the sys module.

*	The code has been changed to use more macros to allow the auto
	generation of the cfunc_t table.


News for version 0.2.1

*	Makefiles tidied up. Now looking to automatic generation
	to handle the multiple platforms.

News for version 0.2

*	This release fixes lots of portability problems. Linux
	and Solaris are actively being used to test the code after
	its development on FreeBSD.

*	The collection has been trimmed down. Only those modules that
	are under active development are in the collection. Modules
	that are not complete enough for any real use have been
	removed.

*	Various problems have been fixed in many modules. All are
	under active use and development.

News for version 0.1

*	There was no news for version 0.1.
