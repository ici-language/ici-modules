cgi.ici is an ici module for interfacing with the HTTP server defacto
standard Common Gateway Interface. The module is intended for auto-loading,
via reference to the name ``cgi''. It exports a number of functions that
support the basic operations of CGI programs. The functions assume the
CGI environment, in that the standard output connects the program the
HTTP client and the program has not produced any output.

The following function objects are exported by the module,

    cgi.start_reply_header([string, string]...)

	Start the CGI program output, specifically the HTTP reply header.
	This should be the first function called by the program. The
	function acccepts optional arguments, pairs of strings, that
	define HTTP reply header fields and their values. Common fields
	have functions to output those header lines.

    cgi.end_reply_header()

	Generate the blank line (CR/LF sequence) that terminates the
	HTTP reply header, subsequent output is content.

    cgi.content_type(string)

	Define the type of the content data. The string argument is the
	MIME type for the output 

    cgi.content_length(int)

	Define the size of the content to be int bytes. This generates
	an HTTP "Content-Length" header.

    cgi.redirect(string)

	Generate a "302 Redirect" message to the URL specified in
	the string argument. Also generates some minimal text output
	for clients that do not understand redirects.

    cgi.setcookie(string [, string])

	Set the cookie in the reply to the specified string. The optional
	argument is cookie options such as an expiration date. This should
	be in the form used by the HTTP protocol and is simply appended
	to the header generated by the function.

    string = cgi.getcookie()

	Return the cookie sent with the HTTP request or NULL if no
	cookie was sent with the request.

    string = cgi.string_to_urle(string)
    string = cgi.urle_to_string(string)

	This functions convert strings to the so-called URLE encoding
	and back. URLE encoding is used in HTTP headers and converts
	spaces to '+' and non alphanumerics to % followed by two hex
	digits.

    struct = cgi.query_string_to_struct([string])

        This function returns the query string sent with the HTTP
	request and turns it into an ici struct objects. Keys in
	the query string value are used as keys for the struct and
	their values mapped accordingly. This function is the whole
	reason to use the module.
