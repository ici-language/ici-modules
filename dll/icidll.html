            <H1>The ICI dll module - Call dynamic libs directly</H1>
<P ALIGN="left">The ICI <I>dll</I> module allows the calling of pre-existing
functions in dynamic loaded libraries directly from
ICI without any explicitly compiled linkage. Calls
have the form:</P>
<PRE>    dll.libname.funcname(args...)</PRE>
<P ALIGN="left">Where <I>libname</I> is used to determine a dynamically
loadable library using the ususal conventions of the
local system. (For example, it might find <I>libname.dll</I>
on Windows, or <I>liblibname.so</I> on many UNIX-like
systems. The usual system search paths will be used.)</P>
<P ALIGN="left">The first time a particular name (such as <I>libname</I>
in this example) is used to index the <I>dll</I> object,
it is resolved to a library which is loaded into the
current processes address space. A special object that
refers to this library is then assigned to that field
of the <I>dll</I> object. Thus subsequent references
to the same library will return the reference to the
same loaded library.</P>
<P ALIGN="left">Function names are resolved in a similar fashion. That
is, on first index the name is looked up in the library
and a special internal linkage function created. This
is assigned to that field of the loaded library object.
Thus subsequent references to the same function name
reference the created linkage function.</P>
<P ALIGN="left">Of course actual calls to the function must have arguments
and return values translated between ICI values and
the native forms. By default, the <I>dll</I> module
will use a set of standard conventions for such translatations.
However for cases where the defaults are not sufficient,
a mechanisn for pre-declaring the calling conventions
of the function exists.</P>
<H1>Details</H1>
<H2>Argument translation</H2>
<P ALIGN="left">The linkage function will follow simple rules to translate
actual arguments made in the ICI call into actual arguments
passed to the library function.</P>
<P ALIGN="left">Up to 8 32 bit words worth of arguments may be passed
to the library function.</P>
<DT>int</DT>
<DD CLASS="DefnIn4cm">Will be passed as a 32 bit integer.
</DD>
<DT>string</DT>
<DD CLASS="DefnIn4cm">Will be passed as a pointer to the internal character
data of the string. If the string is atomic (as almost
all strings are), the function must not modify the
content in any way. If the string is non-atomic (as
created by <I>strbuf()</I>) it may be modified within its
length constraints. Note that the internal representation
of ICI strings have a guard nul character just beyond
their known length, and thus can be used as C nul-terminated
strings. But they may also have internal nul characters
of course.
</DD>
<DT>NULL</DT>
<DD CLASS="DefnIn4cm">A 32 bit 0 will be passed.
</DD>
<DT>array of strings</DT>
<DD CLASS="DefnIn4cm">Will be conveted to an argv style NULL terminated array
of nul terminated strings and passed to the function.
</DD>
<DT>&amp;int</DT>
<DD CLASS="DefnIn4cm">A pointer to an int will be passed as a pointer to
a 32 bit integer value, where that value may be updated
by the called function. Upon return, the updated value
will be converted to an ICI integer and the pointed
to ICI value updated.
</DD>
<H2>Calling conventions - CALLTYPE</H2>
<P ALIGN="left">Even within a single archietcture and operating system,
there are sometimes different calling conventions (meaning
such things as the manner of packing parameters onto
the stack and how the return value is passed back).</P>
<P ALIGN="left">By default, for any particular function, the <I>dll</I>
module will in assume the normal calling convention
that an unadorned C declaration will produce unless
the name is &quot;decorated&quot; in a manner that
indicates otherwise.</P>
<P ALIGN="left">In cases where even this fails (Windows API calls)
it is possible to &quot;declare&quot; that all the
functions in a given library have a certain calling
convention by assigning that convention to the <I>CALLTYPE</I>
field of the library. For example:</P>
<PRE>    dll.user32.CALLTYPE = &quot;winapi&quot;;
    dll.kernel32.CALLTYPE = &quot;winapi&quot;;
    dll.advapi32.CALLTYPE = &quot;winapi&quot;;</PRE>
<P ALIGN="left">This is currently only necessary for Windows. The values
that can be assigned are: <I>stdcall</I> or <I>winapi</I>,
which are equivalent, <I>fastcall</I>, or <I>cdecl</I>.
<I>cdecl</I> is the default.</P>
<H2>Return value translation</H2>
<P ALIGN="left">Currently the return value is assumed to be a 32 bit
int and is returned as an ICI int.</P>
<H2>dll.xxx:DECL(func-name, ...)</H2>
<P ALIGN="left"><I>DECL</I> allows the explicit declaration of functions
that, for some reason, can't be relied on to deduce
their interface from the actual paraeters. For example,
returning a C style nul terminated string rather than
the default 32 bit integer.</P>
