The dll module allows ICI programs to call functions in normal system
shared libraries or DLLs.  The module acts as a wrapper that performs
the name lookups, address resolutions and stack frame marshalling
required to call such functions at run-time.  The module allows other
modules to be written in ICI that interface to system or third-party
libraries without resorting to C or C++ native code modules. Further
documentation is included as part of the module.
