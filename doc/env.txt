The env module provides access to the process environment via a
struct object. Environment variable names are used as string keys into
the struct which stores their, string, values. The environment may
therefore be read and written using normal ici variable accesses.

E.g.,

    forall (directory in gettokens(env.PATH, ":"))
	...  do something

    printf(env.LOGNAME + "'s home directory is " + env.HOME + "\n");

    env.LD_LIBRARY_PATH = env.HOME + ":" + env.LD_LIBRARY_PATH;

The env object is a specialised struct object that uses the
process environment as a "backing store" for things written into the
struct object. When first referenced the struct is initialised from 
the process environment and subsequent writes are trapped and mirrored 
in the environment.
