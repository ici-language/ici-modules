The glx module is the X11 binding portion of the OpenGL module.  It too
is at present non-functional although it is far more complete than the
gl module with its very large number of functions.

There is currently an unresolved problem with the gl/glx module
interaction that prevents any output from appearing in the window!
Complications due to the use of multiple layers of shared objects and
run-time linking is likely to be the cause however this is unproven.
