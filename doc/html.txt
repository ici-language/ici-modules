An ICI-only module that helps generate HTML output.  The functions
perform printf's for you and help structure the program.  Using these
functions is an alternative to scattering printf's and unwieldly format
strings throughout your code.  Generating HTML is verbose and writing
code to do so is even more so however the structure afforded by the
module makes up for many of its short-comings.
