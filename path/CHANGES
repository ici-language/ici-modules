*  Converted to work with ici version 4

   In the process this module was renamed and is now known
   as "pathname".  This is because ici now defines a variable,
   path, which stops loading of the path module.

   The walk function for perfoming a directory traversal has
   been removed as its name, pathname.walk, does not make as
   much sense as it should.  The function will appear in another
   module and be greatly enhanced.
