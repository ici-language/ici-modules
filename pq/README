pq - ici interface to PostgreSQL C API

This module provides interfaces to PostgreSQL. There is a low-level
interface, the PQ module, that is essentially a one-to-one mapping of
the PostgreSQL C API to ICI. This is accompanied by an ICI portion,
PQ.ici that defines constants used in the module interface.  The
second interface, PostgreSQL.ici, uses provides an OO interface to
PostgreSQL using ICI's class mechanism. Database connections and
query results are represented as classes.
