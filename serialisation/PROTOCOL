All objects are preceded by a one-byte tag that identifies the type of object
and if it is atomic. The tag has the same value as the type's code defined in
ici's object.h. Types that have the code TC_OTHER have special codes, above
the maximum ici type code value, defined by the serialisation protocol. If
the object is atomic the top bit of the type tag is set.

Following the type tag is zero or more bytes of type specific representation.

NULL		None.
int		32-bit signed integer in network byte order.
float		Double precision IEEE 754 FP in network byte order.
string		A 32-bit count of the number of bytes of string data
		followed by that many bytes of string data.
regexp		A 32-bit value for the regexp options settings followed by
		the pattern as a string (sent as a 32-bit count followed
		by that many bytes of string data).

Serialisation also transfers some types that are only used internally to the
ici interpreter. These objects are used to represent the "compiled" form of
ici code.
