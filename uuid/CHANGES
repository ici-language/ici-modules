*  Made uuid objects atomic and remove a number of functions
   no longer required due to such atomicity.  In particular
   the compare(), copy() clear() and is_null() functions have
   been removed.  Comparisons may be performed using the '=='
   operator or the `eq()' function.  Copying is no longer
   meaningful and clear() and is_null() are not allowed as
   they would change the underlying UUID value.

*  Converted to work with ici version 4
