ICI libuuid interface. This is an interface to the GPL'd
libuuid included in the ``e2fsprogs'' distribution. This
lets ICI play with UUIDs as used by DCE and COM et al.

To use this requires you have libuuid and its header file.
It's a relatively simple job to extract it from the e2fsprogs
distribution. If you're on a Linux system you probably
already have it (but I don't use Linux so haven't tested it).
