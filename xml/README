This is an interface to Jame Clark's ``expat'' XML parser. Originally
written for ici 2.0 by Scott Newham <snaf@zeta.org.au> then turned into
an ici module and considerably expanded by Andy Newman <atrn@zeta.org.au>.

The module provides a direct ICI interface to expat. It doesn't try to
do much more than wrap the C functions and make them usable from
ICI. Function names are kept the same (with the ``XML_'') and calling
conventions are kept as close to those of the C API as possible.
Additional functionality is provided in the ici portion of the module.
Functions are provided to read an XML stream into memory, process it
and write it back out.

Further documentation is in the doc directory. Example programs are in
the test directory. For building instructions read the Makefiles.
